# Merge Example - Customer Record Deduplication

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Merge** operation: intelligently combining multiple records into a unified result.

This example merges:
- **Input**: 3 customer records from different systems (CRM, Sales, Support)
- **Strategy**: Complex merge rules (most complete name, combine notes, upgrade VIP status)
- **Output**: Single unified customer record

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Customer data deduplication
- Multi-source data consolidation
- Master data management
- Contact merging
- Profile unification
- System migration data cleanup

## How It Works

```go
merged, err := ops.Merge(records, strategy)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Identifies corresponding fields across records
2. Selects the most complete/accurate values
3. Combines complementary information
4. Resolves conflicts using strategy rules
5. Produces a unified result

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output
