7. **Summarize** - Article condensation
8. **Classify** - Sentiment analysis
9. **Score** - Code quality assessment
10. **Compare** - Product comparison
11. **Similar** - ⚠️ Not implemented in library (workaround documented)
12. **Validate** - User registration validation
13. **Merge** - Customer record deduplication
14. **Decide** - Support ticket routing
15. **Guard** - Order state validation

### 📊 Coverage Statistics:
- **Total Operations**: 15 LLM operations
- **Examples Created**: 15 directories
- **Fully Functional**: 14 operations (93%)
- **Library Incomplete**: 1 operation (Similar)

### 🎯 What Each Example Includes:
- ✅ **main.go** - Working implementation
- ✅ **README.md** - Documentation with expected output
- ✅ **Realistic Use Cases** - Real-world applications
- ✅ **Output Demonstrations** - Shows what users will see
- ✅ **API Usage Examples** - Clear patterns

### ⚠️ Note on Similar Operation:
The **Similar** operation has options defined in `ops/analysis.go` but the function implementation is missing from the library. The example documents this and provides workarounds:
- Use `ops.Deduplicate()` for duplicate detection
- Use `ops.Compare()` with `FocusOn="similarities"`

### 🚀 Running the Examples:

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run any example
cd examples/01-extract
go run main.go
```

### 📖 Documentation:
- Each example has detailed README.md
