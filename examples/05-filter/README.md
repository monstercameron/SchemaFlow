# Filter Example - Urgent Ticket Triage

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Filter** operation: selecting items from a list based on natural language criteria.

This example filters:
- **Input**: Array of support tickets
- **Criteria**: Business impact, security concerns, service outages
- **Output**: Only urgent tickets requiring immediate attention

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Support ticket triage and prioritization
- Email filtering and categorization
- Content moderation
- Lead qualification
- Inventory management (find low stock items)

## How It Works

```go
urgentTickets, err := schemaflow.Filter(
    tickets,
    ops.NewFilterOptions().
        WithCriteria([]string{
            "Affects multiple users",
            "Security-related",
            "Service outages",
        }),
)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Evaluates each ticket against criteria
2. Understands business impact
3. Identifies security concerns
4. Recognizes service disruptions
5. Filters out routine requests

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
