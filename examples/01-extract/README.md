# Extract Example - Email Parser

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Extract** operation: converting unstructured text into strongly-typed Go structs.

This example takes a raw email (plain text) and extracts structured fields:
- Sender and recipient
- Subject line
- Date
- Body content
- Auto-generated tags

## Use Case

**Real-World Application**: Parse incoming emails from various sources (customer support, newsletters, notifications) into a structured database.

## How It Works

```go
email, err := schemaflow.Extract[Email](rawEmail, ops.NewExtractOptions())
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Identifies email components
2. Maps them to struct fields
3. Infers data types (string, time.Time, []string)
4. Extracts implicit information (tags based on content)

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
