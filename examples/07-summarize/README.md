# Summarize Example - Article Condensation

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Summarize** operation: condensing long text while preserving key information.

This example summarizes:
- **Input**: Long article (~1800 characters)
- **Output**: Concise summary (~400 characters, ~78% reduction)
- **Preserves**: Main points, key facts, conclusion

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- News aggregation and newsletters
- Document management systems
- Research paper abstracts
- Meeting notes and transcripts
- Email thread summarization

## How It Works

```go
summary, err := ops.Summarize(
    article,
    ops.NewSummarizeOptions().WithMaxLength(200),
)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Identifies main themes and key points
2. Removes redundant information
3. Preserves critical facts and data
4. Maintains logical flow
5. Respects length constraints

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```

AI is transforming healthcare through advanced diagnostics, drug discovery, 
and patient care. Machine learning achieves 94.5% accuracy in detecting 
breast cancer, surpassing human radiologists at 88%. Drug discovery, 
traditionally taking 10-15 years, now completes in weeks with AI. Virtual 
health assistants provide real-time monitoring and personalized treatment. 
However, challenges include data privacy, algorithmic bias, and regulatory 
gaps. Despite these issues, AI is expected to reduce healthcare costs by 
30% and save millions of lives within a decade.
