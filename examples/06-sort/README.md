# Sort Example - Task Prioritization

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Sort** operation: ordering items using natural language criteria and semantic understanding.

This example sorts:
- **Input**: Array of tasks with deadlines, impact, and effort
- **Criteria**: Urgency, business impact, effort (Eisenhower Matrix-style)
- **Output**: Tasks ordered by intelligent priority

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Task management and prioritization
- Issue tracking systems
- Content curation (by relevance/quality)
- Product backlogs
- Search result ranking

## How It Works

```go
sortedTasks, err := schemaflow.Sort(
    tasks,
    ops.NewSortOptions().
        WithCriteria("Priority by urgency, impact, and effort"),
)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Evaluates multiple factors simultaneously
2. Applies prioritization frameworks
3. Balances competing criteria
4. Identifies quick wins
5. Considers deadlines and impact

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
ðŸ“‹ Sort Example - Task Prioritization
==================================================

ðŸ“¥ Unsorted Tasks:
  1. Update documentation (Deadline: Next week)
  2. Fix critical security vulnerability (Deadline: Today)
  3. Add dark mode feature (Deadline: Next month)
  4. Database backup failing (Deadline: ASAP)
  5. Refactor payment module (Deadline: Q2 2025)

âœ… Prioritized Tasks (Highest Priority First):
---

1. ðŸŽ¯ Fix critical security vulnerability
   Deadline: Today
   Impact:   Critical - affects all users, security risk
   Effort:   4 hours
   Why:      Critical security issue with immediate deadline

2. ðŸŽ¯ Database backup failing
   Deadline: ASAP
   Impact:   High - data loss risk
   Effort:   1 hour
   Why:      High impact with minimal effort - quick win

3. ðŸŽ¯ Update documentation
   Deadline: Next week
   Impact:   Low - only affects developers
   Effort:   2 hours
   Why:      Quick task before moving to longer projects

âœ¨ Success! Tasks intelligently prioritized
```
