# Decide Example - Support Ticket Routing

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Decide** operation: intelligently choosing the best option from multiple choices based on context.

This example routes:
- **Input**: Support tickets with various issues
- **Options**: 4 departments with different specialties
- **Output**: Best department with confidence and reasoning

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Ticket routing to departments/agents
- Lead assignment to sales reps
- Task assignment to team members
- Service selection based on requirements
- Resource allocation
- Escalation path determination

## How It Works

```go
chosen, result, err := ops.Decide(ticket, departments)

fmt.Printf("Route to: %s\n", chosen.Name)
fmt.Printf("Confidence: %.0f%%\n", result.Confidence*100)
fmt.Printf("Reasoning: %s\n", result.Explanation)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Analyzes the context (ticket details)
2. Evaluates each option (department capabilities)
3. Considers multiple factors (priority, category, customer)
4. Provides confidence score
5. Explains the reasoning

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
