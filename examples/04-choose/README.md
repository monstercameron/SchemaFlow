# Choose Example - Product Recommender

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Choose** operation: intelligently selecting the best option from a list based on criteria.

This example selects:
- **Input**: Customer query + product catalog
- **Output**: Best matching product with reasoning

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- E-commerce product recommendations
- Support ticket routing
- Content recommendation engines
- Service plan selection
- Best candidate selection from resumes

## How It Works

```go
chosen, err := schemaflow.Choose(
    products,
    ops.NewChooseOptions().
        WithCriteria("I need something portable for coding...").
        WithSteering("Consider budget, portability, and use case"),
)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Analyzes each option against criteria
2. Considers explicit requirements (budget, portability)
3. Infers implicit needs (student-friendly, value)
4. Ranks options by relevance
5. Selects the best match

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
